# Intro
Welcome to my project for gathering info on the stockmarket and trying out
prediction with machine learning.

Nice of you to drop by, but you should know that I do not recommend anyone to
trust or act on any predictions from this project to make any investments. I myself do not
this far and see this as a fun thing to do and learn about.

If you want recommendations on investments, look elsewhere. This ain't it chief.
